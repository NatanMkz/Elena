I was at home thinking about fighting games when I received Elena’s intro from Street Fighter 6 on my phone. At that moment, I thought, “Why aren’t there more apps that teach about fighting games?”
With that in mind, I created Elena. Elena is an unofficial API for Street Fighter 6 — it’s meant for training, development, and having a bit of fun while learning more about Street Fighter.
